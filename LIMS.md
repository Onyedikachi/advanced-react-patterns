# Laboratory Information Management Software Mastery

## General awareness of LIMS Environments and Modules
Generally LIMS constains four(4) environments
- Development env
- Static environment: For the creation of master data like Analytics, product, sample, plan, item code, inventory data etc
- Validation and Quality Environment
- Production Environment

LIMS have the following modules:
- Lot management: Raw materials, Packaging material, recovered solvents and finished products- Lot creation to COA generation and Release of lot
- Inventory management: Chemicals, reagents, indicators, sst solutions, volumetric solutions, standard(working standards, reference standards, calibration standard and primary standards) - Registration of new inventories and qualifying of those for routine usage in workflow
- Instrument management: Calibration schedule, Preventive maintenance schedule and PV schedule, instrument samples logging based on their scheduled frequency, Allocating, analyzing, reviewing and usage
- Stability managment: Creation and Approval of Study, Stability scheduled samples logging,analyzing, reviewing, approving, generation of stability summary report
- Environment motoring: scheduling, allocating, sampling, analyze, review and generation of environmental trend report
- Micro-inventory managment: media, culture, identification
- Batch Manager

## General awareness of Master data management and LIMS roles

Master data contains - Analysis, Product, sample plan, item code,instrument, suppliers, unit, process unit, schedule.

LIMS Roles include
- Analyst
- QC - Supervisor
- QC - Reviewer
- QA - Reviewer
- QA - Approver
- QCM - Supervisor
- QCM - Reviewer
- inventory manager
- system administrator

## Assessing LIMS cost
Cost is dependent on the time spent on implementation. Implementation time in turn
depends on the number of instruments, tests, laboratories etc that shall be implemented.

Initial Cost = cost of purcase  of the systems +  Internal Training time and implementation and validation time cost

Annual Cost = Maintenance cost per year + License for LIMS + cOST OF time spent using new LIMS - Cost of time spent using old paper-based systems

## LIMS Risk Component
- 60% of IT Projects are cancelled prior to implementation due to functional, time and budget constraints

### Risks identified
- No formal Process in place to select and implment LIMS
- Customization AND integration requirements underestimated
- Unrealistic schedule and budge estimates
- Risk management plan not well established


## Guidelines for a successful LIMS implementation
- Business  Case Preparation
- Collect and organize user requirement
- Segment and prioritize
- - P 1- critical to work process
- - priority 2 - improves work process
- - priority 3 - nice to have
- Development of Functional Specification
- Evaluation of Vendor Responses (GAP Analysis)
- Configuration/Customization/Integration
- Validation and Testing
- Planning and maintenance

## Key Messages
- Ensure all data - the final product of the laboratory- is well managed
- Ensure confidentiality and privacy of patient infofmation
- incorporate all the laboratory processes as part of the system.
- assure the accessibility, accuracy, timelines and security of data
- streamline sample tracking & sample workflow in the clinicallaboratory

## Steps for handing samples
- Registration
- Reception
- Work allocation
- Testing
- Validation
- Approval
- Reporting 
- Archival

## Functionalities of LIMS
- The reception and login of a sample and associated customer data
- The assignment, scheduling and tracking of the sample and the associated analytical workload
- The processing and quality control associated with the sample and the utilized equipment and inventory
- The storage of data associated with the sample analysis
- The inspection, approval and compilation of the sample data for reporting and further analysis

## Additional Functions
- audit management
- barcode handling
- change of custody
- compliance
- customer relationship management
- document management
- instrument calibration and maintenance
- inventory and equipment management
- manual and electronic data entry
- method management
- personnel and workload management
- quality assurance and control
- reports
- time tracking
- traceability
- workflows
